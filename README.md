Clock is a small library without dependencies for mocking time in Javascript inspired by [this Go clock package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/facebookgo/clock).

It follows Javascript's Date & Time interface as closely as possible, so you can easily replace Clock in your existing code. The difference is that you have more control over time when you use Clock.
